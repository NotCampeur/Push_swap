In this repository you will find two programs to find and test a sorting algorithm on a stack of int  

Thanks to the stack_gen rule you can generate a random list of NB numbers between INT_MIN and INT_MAX:  
make stack_gen NB={WANTED_LIST_SIZE}

The sort and check rules respectively start the ./push_swap and the ./checker software with ARGS as a list:  
make sort ARGS="$(cat STACK.txt)" || make check ARGS="$(cat STACK.txt)"

The make correc and correc_bonus will count the lines returned by push_swap and send it to checker or checker_visualizer:  
make correc(_bonus) ARGS="$(cat STACK.txt)"

If you want to enable fsanitize for the project you can define DEBUG as follow:  
make DEBUG=true
