In this repository you will find two programs to find and test a sorting algorithm on a stack of int

Thanks to the stack_gen rule you can generate a random list of NB numbers between INT_MIN and INT_MAX:
make stack_gen NB={WANTED_LIST_SIZE}

The sort and check rules respectively start the ./push_swap and the ./checker software with ARGS as a list:
make sort ARGS="$(cat STACK.txt)" || make check ARGS="$(cat STACK.txt)"
